## Problem
New [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)  guidelines provide general rules for protecting the security of user supplied passwords. The goal here is to develop a tool that checks if a password satisfies the following requirements: 
1. Has an 8 character minimum 
2. Has a 64 character maximum
2. Allow only ASCII characters (user note: this includes spaces)
4. Not be a common password
